Cayden Long has cerebral palsy. He also competes in triathlons with his older brother Conner.

Conner tows Cayden behind in a raft during the swimming leg, tows him behind his bike during the cycling portion, and pushes him during the run.

Conner and Cayden received the Sports Illustrated Kids 2012 SportsKids of the Year award. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouhURNLsnjo">What an incredible story...</a>
