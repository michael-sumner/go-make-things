<em>One Nation Under Dog</em> is a new documentary from HBO that explores the relationship we have with dogs.

Dogs are man's best friend. They're often regarded as members of the family. And every year, 4 to 5 million of them are put down because of factors like overcrowding in shelters.

<a href="http://www.pawsnewengland.com/hbo/">PAWS New England</a>, where I adopted my last dog, is a client of mine and is one of a handful of organizations featured in <em>One Nation Under Dog</em>.

In the documentary, you'll learn about Julie Adams, who has spent the last thirty years saving the lives of thousands of animals who make their way to her home. You'll hear about John Gagnon, who's Pet Resort is a sanctuary for rescue dogs that may require special levels of training and rehabilitation.

You'll meet Cherokee, Hope and Crystal, three amazingly special dogs whose stories are powerful and emotional, with far-too-uncommon happy endings.

<em>One Nation Under Dog</em> premiers on HBO on June 18 at 9pm EST. I hope you'll watch.

<h2>What You Can Do</h2>

There are a few ways you can help...

<ul>
<li><strong>Host a screening party.</strong> Have HBO? Why not invite some friends or family over to watch with you?</li>
<li><strong>Adopt.</strong> Rather than buying from a pet store or breeder, why not save a dog's life and adopt instead?</li>
<li><strong>Foster.</strong> Dogs who live in foster homes are significantly more likely to get adopted than dogs in shelters, and are often adopted more quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Donate.</strong> If you don't have the time to take in a dog of your own, you can still fund the life-saving work of the many wonderful rescue organization's around the country.</li>
<li><strong>Spread the word.</strong> Let people know about this documentary, and about the plight of shelter dogs everywhere.</li>
