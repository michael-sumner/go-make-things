Yesterday, someone pointed me to [this hilarious and amazing video from Bruce Lawson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2CjuAwrAq8) at the [Monki Gras Conference](https://monkigras.com/) about how our obsession with JavaScript and front end tooling is breaking the web (sound familiar?).

Bruce urges us to focus more on the basics of the web: semantic HTML, well structured CSS, and JavaScript only when you really need it.

[Watch the whole damn thing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2CjuAwrAq8) It's worth a half hour of your time.
