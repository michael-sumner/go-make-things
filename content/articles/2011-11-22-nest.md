Tony Fadell led the team that created the first 18 generations of the iPod and the first three generations of the iPhone. And now he's back with an exciting new... thermostat?

<a href="http://www.nest.com/index.html">Nest is a thermostat</a> that learns your habits and patterns, and helps you save energy (even if you forget to turn the thermostat down when you leave the house).

<blockquote>As much as the refrigerator, lighting, TVs, computers, and stereos combined. In fact, 10% of all U.S. energy is controlled by thermostats. That’s the equivalent of 1.7 billion barrels of oil per year.

But in most homes the thermostat is an unassuming beige box. It doesn’t matter if it’s a manual or complicated programmable thermostat, we do with it what we’ve always done: get up, walk over to it, and change the temperature. Every few hours. Every day. 1,500 times a year.

We still try to save energy, of course. We turn down the thermostat when we can, we don’t set it too high or low. But we’re human. We forget. Until we see our energy bills.</blockquote>

This is tremendously cool (no pun intended)!
