<h2>A Few Quotes</h2>

After rewatching this a few times, I had to pull out a few of my favorite quotes...

<blockquote>The food will give them physical nutrition. The love and affection which you show will give them mental nutrition.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Everybody has got 5.5 liters of blood. I'm just a human being. For me, everybody is the same.</blockquote>

<blockquote>What's the ultimate purpose of life? It's to give. Start giving! See the joy of giving!</blockquote>
