C.G.P. Grey's latest video, ["Humans Need Not Apply,"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU) is a pretty radical departure from his normal style of video. At 12 minutes, it's much longer than his typical video. He talks much slower, and instead of his normal animations, uses lots of video clips.

In my opinion, it's the best video he's ever produced, and reminds me very much of the [Everything is a Remix series](http://everythingisaremix.info/) (while still being uniquely Grey).

**A few thoughts...**

* Baxter the robot does a great job of being adorable without crossing the uncanny valley.
* I definitely want a self-driving car!
* What *will* happen when robots and computers are capable of replacing a majority (or even large portion) of the work humans do?
