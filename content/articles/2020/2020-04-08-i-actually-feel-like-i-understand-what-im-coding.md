Back in the summer of 2018, I created an online training program designed to help address a common challenge a lot of my students were sharing with me:

> I've memorized a bunch of JavaScript methods and techniques, but struggle with knowing how and when to use them. When I go to build a project from scratch, I have no idea where to start.

Does this sound familiar?

If it does, you're not alone. It's really common!

In response to all of this feedback, I created the [Vanilla JS Academy](https://vanillajsacademy.com), a project-based training program designed to help students learn to "think in JavaScript" and work through complex problems.

## Learning by doing

Last summer, I made some changes to *Academy* based on some observations I've made about how people learn. The feedback has been extremely enthusiastic.

Here's how it works.

- Every other day, you get 1-3 short lessons and a small project. Each project builds on the lessons learned in the ones before it.
- On the in-between days, I share my approach to the project and cover the common issues and mistakes I see peoples make.
- Every other week, you can join video office hours, where I answer any questions and help people get unstuck.

In-between office hours, you have access to a private Slack channel to chat with other students, ask questions, and share your work.

This new structure works so much better for people. I'm seeing so many more "aha!" moments. It's awesome!

Former student [Walter Jenkins explains](https://twitter.com/AvidDabbler/status/1200499438759895046):

> Best investment and course I have taken. If you want a bite sized course that will hold you accountable take this course. I have reduced the amount I Google and use Stackexchange by 50% and actually feel like I understand what I am coding.

"I actually feel like I understand what I'm coding." Hell yes! That's the goal!

## What other people have to say

Walter's not alone. I've gotten so much great feedback on this program.
