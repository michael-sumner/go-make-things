After the last session of [the Vanilla JS Academy](https://vanillajsacademy.com), I decided it was time to makes some changes the program based on feedback from students and some observations I've made about how people learn.

**Over the summer, I started redesigning the program from the ground up.**

I've gotten so many emails over the last month or two asking me when Academy is coming back that I decided to fast track production of the new program.

**Registration for the brand new [Vanilla JS Academy](https://vanillajsacademy.com) officially opens up on September 23, and the program starts on October 14.**

But, if you [sign up for updates on the Academy website](https://vanillajsacademy.com/#ready-to-buy) (or if you already have), you'll get early access to registration and exclusive discounts that will save you a ton of money on the program.

So what's different? A lot!

The Vanilla JS Academy is a project-based training program designed to help you learn to solve problems and think in JS. 

It helps solve one of the biggest challenges facing newer students: inertia. 

**Here’s how it works...**

1. Every other day, you get a project to work on, one to three short lessons that provide some background info, and a template to help you get started
2. On the in-between days, I share my approach to the project and some of the common challenges and “gotchas” that students often run into.

Instead of trying to tackle a big project over the course of a week or two, getting stuck or overwhelmed, and giving up, you’ll start building cool stuff right away.

You’ll rack up a series of early wins that keep you motivated and inspired to keep going.

If you get stuck, there’s a private Slack channel exclusively for students going through the program where you can ask questions, share work in progress, and get feedback. And every two weeks, I host an open video office hours where you can ask questions about anything that you’re struggling with.

These small, focused projects build on each other. You’ll use the skills you learned the day before on the project you’re working on today.

These small, incremental learning moments really add up over time. In this 10 week program, you’ll learn...

- DOM manipulation, injection, and traversal
- How to transform and edit strings, numbers, arrays, and objects
- ES6 fundamentals
- How to structure and organize code
- How to save data locally
- Ajax and HTTP
- How to work with APIs
- How to write JavaScript plugins
- How to build framework-free web apps and games
- How to easily write cross-browser compatible code
- How to debug broken code
- JavaScript performance tricks
- Web accessibility fundamentals

You’re going to learn a *lot* in 10 weeks.

You’re going to get stuck, you’re going to get frustrated, and you’re going to push through it and feel so amazing when you finally figure out how to make that code work the way you want it to.

You’re going to work hard, you’re going to build amazing things, and you’re going to become a better web developer as a result.

If you have any questions along the way, please reach out and let me know. Cheers!
