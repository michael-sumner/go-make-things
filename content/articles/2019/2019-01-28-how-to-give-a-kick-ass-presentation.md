Last week, I gave a talk on [*The Lean Web* at Boston CSS](https://www.meetup.com/Boston-CSS/events/257820788/). It was a lot of fun!

The event wasn't recorded, but this Wednesday at 11am US Eastern, I'm giving a live online version of it that's open to the public. The event can only hold 100 people, and it's a first-come-first-in type event. You can join the meeting at https://zoom.us/j/725027016.

If you want a preview, here are the slides.

<p><script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="ca8c68b8a6984cd197fa9a5da15c16cc" data-ratio="1.77777777777778" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script></p>

After the event, a few people mentioned how much they loved the slides and wanted to know more about how I put the presentation together.

I used to *suck* at public speaking, and slideware in particular. School and corporate life do slides *very* badly, and it's infectious.

Everything I know about good slide design I learned from [Garr Reynolds and his amazing book/talk, *Presentation Zen*](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321811984?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=0321811984&linkCode=xm2&tag=presentatio00-20). The book is great, but [Garr gave a Google Talk (available on YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ2vtQCESpk) that I think is actually a better intro to the subject.

If you care about spreading your ideas, take the hour to watch the whole thing. It's well worth it!
