Last month, I gave a talk at Boston CSS on the The Web. The talk wasn't recorded, but I just put together a video of the talk so you can watch it anyways.

I'll be making some changes based on questions I got from the audience, but I thought it was better to get something out there now rather than wait until it’s perfect.

If you want me to give this talk at your conference or organization, sent me an email and let me know.
