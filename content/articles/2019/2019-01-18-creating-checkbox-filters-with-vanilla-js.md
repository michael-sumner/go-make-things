Today, I thought I'd do a live-coding session for one of the projects on my new [Learn Vanilla JS roadmap](https://learnvanillajs.com/projects/).

I recorded myself working through creating checkboxes to filter songs by genre from a playlist.

I've never built this one before, and I also didn't plan this out ahead of time. I thought you might find it interesting to see how I approach a new project from scratch.
