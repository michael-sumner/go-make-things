Last week, [I joined Kevin from JSParty](https://changelog.com/jsparty/258) to talk about the rise and fall of JS libraries, and whether or not JavaScript is the new PHP.

We talked about a collection of trends&mdash;from smaller microlibraries to compilers to a push towards static HTML&mdash;and whether or not they represent a looming shift in how we build things for the web.
