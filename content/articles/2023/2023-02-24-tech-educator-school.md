I'm thinking about putting together a course for folks who want to learn how to become paid tech educators. Topics might include things like...

- How to start a newsletter
- How to start a podcast
- How to YouTube
- How to create an ebook
- How to create/host a video course
- How to find your audience/students
- How to market your stuff
- The "business stuff"
	+ Do I need an LLC?
	+ How long will it take to be profitable? 
	+ How to build a side-business while keeping your day job

If that sounds like something you'd be interested in, let me know! 

Are there any topics you're particularly excited about? Anything not on the list you'd like to learn more about? Any specific questions about my journey that you have?
