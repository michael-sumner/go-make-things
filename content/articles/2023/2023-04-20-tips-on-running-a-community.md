For the last 7 years or so, I've run [a private community for developers who want to build a simpler, more resilient web](https://gomakethings.com/membership/). Today, I wanted to share what I've learned about running a thriving online community.

Let's dig in!

## Which platform should you pick?

Slack? Discord? Something else?

Honestly, it doesn't matter much. They're both great and they're both awful in their own unique ways. Discord has some nicer moderation features. Slack has "Remind me later," which is absolutely essential for how I run my business and my ADHD brain.

Both support channels and restricted access to things and threads and all the other essentials.

I'd recommend picking the one you find easiest to get started with and not worrying about it all that much beyond that.

## You get the community you deserve

It’s important to model the behavior you want to see, make expected behavior clear from the start, and weed out people who violate expectations early and publicly.

The places without good moderation are cesspools of awful.

I’m REALLY quick to call out behavior that impacts marginalized groups.

It’s almost never intended. People (specifically white men) often use hurtful language without realizing it or thinking about it. I tend to be soft about it.

> Hey, I’m sure you didn’t mean anything by this, but {harmful behavior} is often perceived as {bad thing} by {group}. Can we avoid doing that?

For intentional violations, I boot people without hesitation. You're gone in 60 seconds, with a very public message about what happened and why.

[Here are my community guidelines](https://gomakethings.com/community-guidelines/), which everyone agrees to before joining.

## Stoking the conversation fire

Early on, when have not that many members, you’ll likely need to stoke conversation by asking provocative questions and encouraging participation.

Like a good fire, once the community gets going, that starts to take care of itself.
