When I first created my [courses and ebooks on vanilla JS](https://vanillajsguides.com), most of what you did with JavaScript was basic DOM manipulation. Since then, the nature of front end web development has changed quite a bit.

Last week, I put together two new course bundles that reflect how the web has evolved over the last few years.

**[The Fundamentals Bundle](https://vanillajsguides.com/fundamentals-bundle/)** covers... 

- DOM manipulation and injection
- How to work with and manipulate data in the form of strings, numbers, arrays, and objects
- Browser storage
- How to work with APIs and asynchronous JavaScript.

**[The Level-Up Bundle](https://vanillajsguides.com/level-up-bundle/)** includes courses on...

- Writing libraries
- ES modules
- Service Workers
- Web Components
- State-based UI
- Testing JavaScript

My previous collection of bundles had grown large and confusing.

Now, each bundle includes 7 courses or ebooks (or both), covers a clearly defined set of topics, and saves you 40% over buying each guide individually.
