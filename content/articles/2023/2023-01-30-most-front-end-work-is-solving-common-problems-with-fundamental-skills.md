One of the most reassuring and surprising things I learned early in my career is that a majority of the people you look up to in this industry are self-taught, and do not have a CS degree.

Just because a vocal minority of developers at those big tech companies all have PhD’s in Computer Science doesn’t mean that the typical developer does. And to be honest, most tech interviews, evaluate people on things that have absolutely nothing to do with what we actually do every day.

Most front end work is just solving common and repeatable problems using fundamental skills.
