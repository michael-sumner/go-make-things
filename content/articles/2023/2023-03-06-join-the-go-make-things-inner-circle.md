I have an amazing community of developers who want to build a simpler and more resilient web.

And now, I have a way for you to become a part of that community _and_ help me create even more vanilla JavaScript learning resources like this newsletter, my podcast, and the vanilla JS toolkit.

**With [a Lean Web Club membership](https://gomakethings.com/membership/), you can get access to my private Slack community.**

This is normally only available with the purchase of a course bundle or workshop, and my students regularly tell me it's is one of the most valuable parts of those programs.

I have a bunch of membership tiers available, starting at as little as $5/month. The perks are the same at each level, so pick whichever one makes the most sense for you. 

I'll also throw in a bunch of free bonus gifts, and am planning to run some just-for-members live online events through the year.
