If you're someone who likes to learn from video, I just started posting regularly to [the Go Make Things YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@gomakethings/).

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/01rd7YzSK1o" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

I'll be posting there each week, and am currently working on a series of videos around DOM manipulation basics for beginners.

Check it out, and if you enjoy the videos, don't forget to like, share, and subscribe.
