This week, I joined Paul Mikulskis on the [LogRocket podcast to talk about the rise and fall of JavaScript libraries](https://podrocket.logrocket.com/state-of-js-frameworks).

We talked about the ebb-and-flow of tools in the web development industry, how tools like React are about to be replaced by something new (and potentially better), and how we too often use the wrong tool for the job.

 > State-based UI libraries provide an incredible benefit for certain types of user interfaces and add a lot of overhead and create a lot of potential break points in many, many others. But we have a tendency today to just use them for everything. So, for me, that's what it's really about, being a little bit more thoughtful about the tools that we choose to use and when and why we choose to use them.
