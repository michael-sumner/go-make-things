In three weeks, [I'll be joining Vitaly Friedman from Smashing Mag for a 1-hour conversation](https://ti.to/smashingmagazine/a-smashing-hour-chris) about vanilla JS, the rise and fall of JavaScript libraries, being a developer with ADHD, and more.

If you have an hour to spare on April 26, I hope you'll join us for this free, live, online event.
