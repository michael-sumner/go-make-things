A common challenge I hear from people who are learning to code is how hard it is to _remember all the things_.

One thing you'll learn as you get deeper into programming is that even senior developers look stuff up ALL THE TIME.

It's important to remember concepts and high level approaches, but don't worry about remembering the details. You can always look that stuff up when you need it.

Hell, [I built an entire website of regularly used code snippets](https://vanillajstoolkit.com) to make it easier for to copy/paste and look up common stuff I was using frequently.
