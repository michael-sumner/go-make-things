I recently had the pleasure of [chatting with Tim Bourguignon from the DevJourney Podcast about my path from HR pro to vanilla JS guy](https://devjourney.info/Guests/240-ChrisFerdinandi).

On the show, we talked about my path from HR blogging to hobby developer to "oh wait my job sucks I'd rather do web development." I shared my tips and tricks for navigating that process, including how I found open roles, how I created a resume that got me interviews, how I failed dozens of interviews in my first year, and how I actually landed my first job.

We also dug into what it's like to be a dev with ADHD, and how I transformed my side-hustle into a full time business.

If any of this sounds interesting, [you can listen to the whole conversation here](https://devjourney.info/Guests/240-ChrisFerdinandi).
