A few weeks ago, I had the pleasure of [chatting with Saron Yitbarek on the CodeNewbie podcast about the next wave of developer tools](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/the-new-wave-of-frontend-developer-tools-are-on-their-way).

Saron is one of the best interviewers I've ever had the pleasure of chatting with. [She and I talked a few years ago about vanilla JS](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/what-is-vanilla-js-and-how-can-it-help-you), so it was nice to review web development at a time when lots of things are in flux.
