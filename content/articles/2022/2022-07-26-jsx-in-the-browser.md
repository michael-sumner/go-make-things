One often-repeated refrain from the React crowd is "build JSX into the browser, you cowards!"

And I've never quite understood that, because JSX already _is_ built into the browser... as template literals.

Let's dig in!

## What is JSX?

[JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) that's used to create elements in React.

Consider the traditional way of generating a multiline HTML string.

```js
let greeting =
	'<h1>Hello, world!</h1>' +
	'<p>How are you today?</p>';
```

In JSX, you can do this.

```jsx
let greeting = (
	<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
	<p>How are you today?</p>
);
```

JSX also makes it easier to add variables and functions. You just wrap them in curly brackets.

Instead of this...

```js
let name = 'Merlin';
let greeting =
	'<h1>Hello, ' + name + '!</h1>' +
	'<p>How are you today?</p>';
```

You can do this...

```jsx
let name = 'Merlin';
let greeting = (
	<h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>
	<p>How are you today?</p>
);
```

Cool, ok. I see the benefit of this.

## What are template literals?

Template literals provide developers with an easier way to create HTML strings in JavaScript.

Instead of using double or single quotes, you use backticks. Unlike a traditional string, the stings you create with template literals can span multiple lines. without any special characters or escaping.

```js
let greeting = 
	`<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
	<p>How are you today?</p>`;
```

Look familiar?

Template literals also allow for _string interpolation_. That's a fancy way of saying that you can include variables and functions as part of the string. You wrap the variable or function in curly brackets with a leading `$`.

```js
let name = 'Merlin';
let greeting = 
	`<h1>Hello, ${name}!</h1>
	<p>How are you today?</p>`;
```

And here's where I get stuck.

Because when React evangelists say that template literals are a bad implementation of JSX, I have no idea what they're talking about. They do pretty much the same thing, and they're awesome!

## What can JSX do that template literals can't?

[Sanitization.](/how-to-sanitize-html-strings-with-vanilla-js-to-reduce-your-risk-of-xss-attacks/)

> By default, React DOM escapes any values embedded in JSX before rendering them. Thus it ensures that you can never inject anything thatâ€™s not explicitly written in your application. Everything is converted to a string before being rendered. This helps prevent XSS (cross-site-scripting) attacks.

There's no browser-native feature for this... yet. 

But the [HTML Sanitizer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Sanitizer_API) (currently an experimental feature) will fix that once it's finally released.

So next time you see someone ranting about putting JSX in the browser, tell them it already is.
