Lately, I've been seeing the Twitter web dev grifters all posting the same format of tweet...

> HTML & CSS => Git & GitHub => Tailwind & Sass => JavaScript => React/Vue => TypeScript => NodeJS => MongoDB
> 
> Congrats, you're a front end developer!

Wow, that's some gatekeeping nonsense!

Here's the more accurate version.

> Enough HTML to cobble together a static webpage...
> 
> Congrats, you're a front end developer!

That's it. That's the benchmark. HTML.

CSS is great, and incredibly powerful. JavaScript can add all sorts of interactivity and app-like functionality. Tooling on top of them can make what you build easier (or harder and worse for users).

But all that you need to be a front end developer is HTML. That's the foundation.
