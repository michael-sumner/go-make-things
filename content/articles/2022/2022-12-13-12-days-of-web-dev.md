'Tis the season! In addition to the [Advent of JavaScript](/advent-of-javascript-2022/) that I mentioned yesterday, my friend Steph Eckles (creator of [SmolCSS](https://smolcss.dev/) and [Modern CSS](https://moderncss.dev/)) just launched [12 Days of Web](https://12daysofweb.dev/).

[12 Days of Web](https://12daysofweb.dev/) is... 

> A year-end celebration of fundamental web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript." 

It features 12 articles about modern, fundamental web tech that lets you do cool stuff more easily! The first article in the series is from the legendary Eric Meyer, and is about [modern viewport units](https://12daysofweb.dev/2022/new-viewport-units/).

I have in article in the series about the amazing `FormData` browser API.

Head over to [12 Days of Web](https://12daysofweb.dev/) to view them as they come out. You can share your email to get them sent to your inbox, and there's also an auto-discoverable RSS feed if that's more your thing.
