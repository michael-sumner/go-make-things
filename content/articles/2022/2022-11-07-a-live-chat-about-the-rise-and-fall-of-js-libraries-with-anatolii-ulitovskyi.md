What are talking about, exactly? I believe we're at the start of a time of transition on the web, where the platform is about to gain a bunch of cool new features, and a new set of tools is going to slowly replace what we use today.

We're going to dig into how tools like Vue and React rose to dominance, why I think they're on their way out, and what I believe comes next.
