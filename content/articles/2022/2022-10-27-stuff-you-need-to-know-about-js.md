Tomorrow at [10am US Eastern](https://everytimezone.com/s/76bdd49e), I'll be [joining Stephanie Eckles on her Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/5t3phDev) to talk about a bunch of JavaScript methods and browser APIs that will make your life easier.

I'll be sharing some of my favorite approaches and techniques to building for the web with JS.
