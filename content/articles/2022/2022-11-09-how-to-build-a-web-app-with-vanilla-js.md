In January, I'll be running [a brand new Vanilla JS Academy workshop on how to build web apps from scratch](https://vanillajsacademy.com/expert/).

Discounted registration will open for a limited window during Black Friday week, but today, I wanted to tell you a bit more about this awesome new program.

Let's dig in!

## How it works

[The _Web Apps_ workshop](https://vanillajsacademy.com/expert/) is designed to help you build dynamic web apps with JS.

1. **Every other day, you get a project to work on,** 1-3 short lessons that provide some background, and a template to help you get started.
2. **On the in-between days, I share my approach to the project** and some of the common challenges and “gotchas” that students often run into.

If you get stuck, there’s a **24/7 private Slack channel** exclusively for students, and **video office hours** every few weeks.

I've taught many, many students using this approach, and it's absurdly effective. Each day builds on the one before. You make consistent progress, and learn how to break big projects up into smaller parts.

## Building an ecommerce platform from scratch

For this workshop, you’ll build an ecommerce platform for Sparrow Photography Studio, a pirate-themed photographer.

Over the course of several weeks, you’ll build an online store front, add a shopping cart, and build a checkout system powered by Stripe. Then, you’ll create a dashboard you can use to manage your product inventory, secured behind a login screen.

This is a great project that covers a wide range of skills that you can use beyond the workshop.

## What you'll learn

This workshop covers a wide range of topics, including...

- State-based UI
- Routing
- Data reactivity
- DOM diffing
- JavaScript Proxies
- ES Modules
- Reactive components
- How to structure complex apps
- Serverless
- How to create custom APIs
- Working with databases
- Token-based authentication
- API security best practices
- How to get and set URL parameters
- The History API
- Third-party API integration

Because everyone learns a little differently, all of the lessons include both written text and streaming HD videos (with captions). You can watch or read on any device with an internet connection, and even download videos for offline viewing.

In just a few weeks, I'll be opening up [a limited registration](https://vanillajsacademy.com/expert/) as part of a huge Black Friday Sale. You'll get 50-percent off registration _and_ $673 in bonus products.
