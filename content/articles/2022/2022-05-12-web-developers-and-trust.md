[Jeremy Keith wrote an article on trust](https://adactio.com/journal/19021) that adds another interesting angle to [my article yesterday on the systems that cause developers to choose libraries over browser-native technology](/are-developers-lazy/).

> Developers are more likely to trust, say, Bootstrap than they are to trust CSS grid or custom properties. Developers are more likely to trust React than they are to trust web components.
> 
> On the one hand, I get it. Bootstrap and React are very popular. That popularity speaks volumes. If lots of people use a technology, it must be a safe bet, right?
> 
> But if weâ€™re talking about popularity, every single browser today ships with support for features like grid, custom properties, service workers and web components. No third-party framework can even come close to that install base.

Jeremy's whole article is worth a read. [You can find it here.](https://adactio.com/journal/19021)
