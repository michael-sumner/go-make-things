On Thursday, I'll be [chatting with Alex Trost over at Frontend Horse about our experiences working with ADHD](https://frontend.horse/episode/working-with-adult-adhd).

I've known I had ADHD since I was a kid. Alex was recently diagnosed.

We'll be discussing the different ways ADHD impacts our work and our life, and some of the strategies we use to get things done in a neurotypical world. [I hope you can join us!](https://frontend.horse/episode/working-with-adult-adhd)
