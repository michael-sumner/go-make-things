Earlier this month, I wrote about how [fundamentals matter](/fundamentals-matter/). I was delighted by a recent [talk by Andy Bell from Hey Presents called "Be the browser’s mentor, not its micromanager."](https://heypresents.com/talks/be-the-browser-s-mentor-not-its-micromanager)

I absolutely love the approach that Andy advocates for: give the browser direction, and let it work out the details. [His approach to writing CSS, which he named CUBE,](https://cube.fyi/) is very close to what I do, with a bit more structure to it.

The talk is full of great quotables, but this one really stands out.

> Get the HTML right and you’ve built a solid foundation. If not, you’re building on sand.

Andy also digs into how you can use tools like Tailwind, without letting them completely takeover your project.
