I've worked with a lot of students over the last few years. Some of them have been completely new to web development. Others were experienced developers who mostly worked in other languages and wanted to learn JavaScript.

Honestly, the only difference between a junior and senior developer is that you get better at identifying all the places where your code goes to shit.

When you're a senior developer, stuff still goes wrong pretty often. You just get more efficient at identifying what, why, and how to fix it.
