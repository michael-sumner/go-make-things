Last week, I [joined the folks at the JavaScript LA meetup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su89GGquMlI) to chat about [what it's like to be a developer with ADHD](/being-a-developer-with-adhd/).

This was more of an open conversation than most of my events, and I really enjoyed chatting with bunch of fellow ADHDers about some of the things we struggle with and some of the ways we work around those challenges.

If that's you, or if you just want to learn more about ADHD, [you can watch the whole thing here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su89GGquMlI).
