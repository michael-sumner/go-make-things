Truthfully, knowing specific JavaScript methods and browser APIs isn't really that important.

What's more important&mdash;and a lot harder&mdash;is understanding how to put all of the little pieces together to build a working script. 

It's something so many people who are learning to code struggle with.

## The chicken and egg problem

You read a bunch of tutorials, watch some courses, then sit down to build a little something and... _nothing_.

Over the years, I've found that the best way to bridge that gap is by working on projects. Lots and _lots_ of projects.

**But that creates a chicken and egg problem.**

If you can't figure out where to start, how do you complete a project? And how do you come up with projects to work on? And what happens when you get stuck?

## The proverbial chicken

A few years ago, I put together a workshop designed to address the chicken-and-egg problem.

(_I'm really forcing this metaphor. Sorry!_)

I created a series of projects designed to start small, get more challenging over time, and build on each other. The skills you learned in yesterday's project would help with the one you were working on today.

Each project came with a few lessons and a starting template, but didn't give you all of the answers. I setup a Slack channel to help answer questions if anyone got stuck, and held live video office hours a few times to work through the really in-depth stuff.

**That workshop eventually became [the Vanilla JS Academy](https://vanillajsacademy.com).**

Academy is hands-down the most successful JavaScript learning program I've ever built. Students finish the program with so much more confidence in their own skills, and the ability to do things they didn't think they'd ever be able to.

Since then, I've helped over 800 students really master JavaScript.

**[A new session of the Vanilla JS Academy](https://vanillajsacademy.com) is starting on October 10,** and registration opens up on Monday. 

**All next week, you'll be able to get 40% off registration with the code `EARLYBIRD`.** I wanted to give you a heads up so that you don't miss it.
