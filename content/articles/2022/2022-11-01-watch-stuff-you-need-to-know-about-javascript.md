Last week, [Steph Eckles had me on her Twitch stream](https://www.twitch.tv/5t3phDev) to share my favorite JavaScript tips and tricks.

Twitch deletes recordings after a couple of weeks, so [Steph told me I could share my own hosted copy with you here](https://vimeo.com/765031482/0be670494f).

You can also [download all of the source code from the stream on GitHub](https://gist.github.com/cferdinandi/3408501c83a2d3c3f1e664817dd4b975) (_including some stuff we didn't get to talk about_).
