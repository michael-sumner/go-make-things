Today, I wanted to talk about emoji, and how weirdly JavaScript (and other programming languages) handle them.

Specifically, emoji never have a `length` property of `1`, which makes a lot of things harder than they should be. This came up during the current session of [the Vanilla JS Academy workshop](https://vanillajsacademy.com), and one of my students came up with a simple solution for counting emoji length.

Let's dig in!

## The problem

Let's look at the ice cream cone emoji: `üç¶`. If you call the `length` property on it, you get a value of `2`.

```js
let str = 'üç¶';

// returns 2
str.length;
```

Why is that?

I'm by no means the first person to write about this. [Henri Sivonen provides one of the most detailed and clear explanations](https://hsivonen.fi/string-length/) I've ever read on the topic, using the facepalm emoji (`ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è`) as an example.

Instead of being an emoji-specific modifier like the skin tone, the gender specification uses an emoji-predating gender symbol (MALE SIGN) explicitly ligated using the ZERO WIDTH JOINER with the (skin-toned) face-palming person. (Whether it is a good or a bad idea that the skin tone and gender specifications use different mechanisms is out of the scope of this post.)

Different programming languages handle which _scalar values_ to count differently. 

In JavaScript, the facepalm emoji has a `length` of `7`. In Python 3, it's `5`. In Rust, its `17`.

So... how do you count an emoji as a single character, then?

## A simple solution to counting emoji as single characters

A lot of approaches I see use complex regex patterns to try to find and isolate emoji in strings. 

One of my students in my Academy workshop came up with a simpler solution: a `for...of` loop and a `count` variable.

```js
let str = 'üç¶üéâ';
let count = 0;

for (let char of str) {
	count++;
}

// logs 2
console.log(count);

// logs 4
console.log(str.length);
```

[Here's a demo.](https://codepen.io/cferdinandi/pen/wvpxOJM?editors=1111)

It's a bit annoying to have to loop and count instead of just using the `length` property, but this approach is simple, readable, and works. Good enough for me!
