It's interesting to think about how much different our industry would be if more people built things to last.

So much of our work is spent chasing trends and shiny objects instead of building simple, durable, useful tools that stick around for a while. 

I think that's one of the things that appeals to me most about platform-native features over libraries. Even when newer features come out, the old ones just keep on working.
