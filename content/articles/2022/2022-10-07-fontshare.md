If you're looking for an alternative to Google Fonts, you might enjoy [Fontshare](https://www.fontshare.com/).

It has about 100 fonts in a variety of styles. I particularly enjoy the [Pairs](https://www.fontshare.com/pairs) feature, combinations of heading and body fonts that look nice together.

If you appreciate good design but have no actual talent for it (like me!), this might be a useful resource.
