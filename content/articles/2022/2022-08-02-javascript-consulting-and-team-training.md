If you work on or manage a team, I wanted to let you know about two newish ways I can help you on your next project.

Ever wish you had a trusted JavaScript expert you could ask questions whenever you felt stuck on something or just needed someone to bounce a few ideas off of?

**[With JavaScript consulting](https://gomakethings.com/consulting/)**, you get unlimited access to me by phone, email, and chat. Throughout the duration of your project, Iâ€™ll be available to review progress, answer questions, and generally keep the code clean from the outset.

If you want to level-up the skills of your team, **[JavaScript training for teams](https://gomakethings.com/training/)** is a great option. includes a combination of approaches designed for deeper learning and better retention with remote teams: self-paced learning, project-based workshops, regular office hours, and a private community for your team.

**I have limited availability for consulting and team training in early fall,** so if you're interested, don't wait! 

[Send me an email](https://gomakethings.com/about/) with a few details about your project, and we can determine if I might be a good fit to help you out.
