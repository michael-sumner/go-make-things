I'm pretty open about [being a developer with ADHD](/being-a-developer-with-adhd/), and the unique challenges and benefits that come with it. 

[Delaney King recently wrote an amazing thread about ADHD](https://twitter.com/delaneykingrox/status/1563010734262722561) that I found immensely helpful. One bit in particular, though, really jumped out at me...

> You aren't neurotypical. You won't be. Their standards will never fit you. Just try to aim for keeping the ball of life up in the air with what you have.
>
> Your space will be messy, your laundry never up to date, you will have doom piles. You win the battles you can.

This idea of self-acceptance is something I've really come to own in the last few years, but I feel like everyone needs to hear it every now and then.

Even people who _aren't_ neurodiverse.

You're good enough. Be kind to yourself.
