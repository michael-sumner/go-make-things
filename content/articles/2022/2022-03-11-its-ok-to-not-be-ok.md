> This world is just f&ast;cking sad, and staying informed has become exhausting. Staying up to date just means keeping up with everyone else’s trauma, plus yours.

A week later, and the quote continues to stick with me.

I've felt a bit uncomfortable just shifting back to talking about tech with everything that's going on in the world. Sometimes the world is such a terrible, terrible place that I need to bury my head in the sand and just focus on tech to cope. 

(_I understand that I'm in a place of tremendous privilege to be able to do so._)

Other times, I let the sadness of it all consume me, and ADHD hyperfocus on how terrible everything is. It's how I personally cope.

If you're feeling either of these extremes, too... I see you! 

It's ok to just be sad. It's ok to tune out and focus on tech or a hobby for the sake of your mental health, especially if you're not in a position to actually do anything. 

It's ok to not be ok right now. ❤️
