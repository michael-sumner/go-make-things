Last week, [Pariss Athena tweeted](https://twitter.com/ParissAthena/status/1500661323352485891)...

> This world is just f&ast;cking sad, and staying informed has become exhausting. Staying up to date just means keeping up with everyone else’s trauma, plus yours.

A week later, that quote continues to stick with me.

I've felt a bit uncomfortable just shifting back to talking about tech with everything that's going on in the world. Sometimes the world is such a terrible, terrible place that I need to bury my head in the sand and just focus on tech to cope. 

(_I understand that I'm in a place of tremendous privilege to be able to do so._)

Other times, I really wallow in the sadness of it all, and talk about how terrible everything is constantly in a mix of sadness and anger. It's how I personally cope.

If you're feeling either of these extremes, too... I see you! It's ok to not be ok right now. ❤️
