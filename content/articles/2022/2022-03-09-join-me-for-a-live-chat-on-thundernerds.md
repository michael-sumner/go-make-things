Tomorrow (Thursday, March 10, 2022) [at 7:30pm Eastern](https://everytimezone.com/s/9d95c4da), I'll be [joining the folks from Thunder Nerds for a live chat about JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDf7nXKmeZI), the modern web, switching careers, ADHD, and more!

It will be recorded, but if you want to watch live and heckle me on Twitter, all the better!
