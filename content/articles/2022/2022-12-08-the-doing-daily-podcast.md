The reason [my Daily Developer Tips newsletter](https://gomakethings.com/articles) exists at all is because [Jonathan Stark](https://jonathanstark.com/) and [Philip Morgan](https://philipmorganconsulting.com/) repeatedly insisted I should in Jonathan's business coaching Slack until I finally relented and agreed to try it for a month.

It was hands-down the single most impactful thing I've ever done for my business, and I'm so grateful that Jonathan and Philip wouldn't stop nagging me about it!

My newsletter is my ~~primary~~ only sales channel.

When I started writing daily, I had a weekly "wrap-up" style newsletter with 38 subscribers that hadn't grown in months. After four weeks of daily writing, I'd hit 100 subscribers. After a year, I reached 1,000 subscribers. By the end of year two, I'd hit 3,000 subscribers.

Today, nearly 14,000 people read my emails each weekday, and my education business generates enough money that I was able to quit my day job early this year to do it full time.

So when Jonathan asked if I wanted to [jump on a podcast with him to chat about what that transition was like](https://doingdaily.transistor.fm/episodes/chris-ferdinandi), how it works, and why I'm still doing it, I couldn't wait!

[Doing Daily](https://doingdaily.transistor.fm/) is a new podcast mini-series where Jonathan Stark interviews folks at various stages of writing a daily newsletter to talk about their process, hurdles, and lessons learned.

Definitely check out the whole series, but [you can listen to my interview with Jonathan here](https://doingdaily.transistor.fm/episodes/chris-ferdinandi).
