My friend [Allie Nimmons](https://allienimmons.com/) is a talented designer, WordPress developers, and community manager, and the cofounder of [Underrepresented in Tech](https://www.underrepresentedintech.com/).

Next week, she'll be [running a workshop on _How to be an ally_](https://allienimmons.com/workshop/), and its going to be really good!

This workshop is good for...

> - People who have been called a racist and don't understand why
> - People who want to unlearn toxic behaviors 
> - People who are allies, but want to be stronger ones

If you can't attend live, a recording of the workshop will be shared afterwards. If you care about inclusion in tech, I really hope you'll consider attending.
