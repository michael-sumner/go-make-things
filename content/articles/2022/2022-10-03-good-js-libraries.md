A lot of folks assume that, as a vanilla JS advocate, I don't like frameworks or libraries at all. But what I actually dislike is libraries that encourage bad, user-hostile habits for the sake of developer convenience.

[Scott Jehl articulated my general feelings quite well](https://twitter.com/scottjehl/status/1575840736158703616) in a recent Twitter thread (abridged here, so go read the full thing)...

> The big opportunity of a web framework or library, in my opinion, is to provide an easy way for developers to do something that is hard or inconvenient, that makes a site more accessible/fast/resilient for users. Good tools make doing the better thing as easy as cutting corners...
> 
> Make the defaults enforce good practices so more sites will use good practices...
> 
> If the default of your tool is to do the thing that's worse for user experience, and your tool gets popular... well, we have what we have today: lots of sites that are built in a way that's worse for user experience. The job of a tool is to make doing the right thing the default.

By way of example, I like static site generators (SSGs) like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) over client-side libraries because they give me a similar authoring experience, but output a format that's faster and more resilient for the people who use what I build.

I think we're seeing more of this, honestly! I look forward to a future where tools make doing the right thing easier.
