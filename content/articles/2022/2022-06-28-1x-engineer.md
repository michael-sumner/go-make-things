Ever heard of a _10x engineer_? They're this mythical creature that allegedly generates ten times the value of a _typical engineer_.

I was _utterly delighted_ when someone shared [the 1x engineer website](https://1x.engineer/) with me! The site includes a list of "qualities that make up a 1x engineer," and they sure are great!

> - Searches Google, Duckduckgo, Bing, or wherever they like when they're not sure what's up.
> - Copy/pastes code snippets from Stack Overflow, Glitch, Codepen, or wherever they find answers.
> - Gives credit where credit is due.
> - Creates community and shares knowledge.
> - Spends time on things outside of engineering, like hobbies, friends, and family.
> - Has a schedule that allows them to maintain a healthy work-life balance, and respects others' time-boundaries, too.
