[Keith Cirkel from GitHub wrote an article about his team builds the GitHub website.](https://github.blog/2022-06-10-how-we-think-about-browsers/)

One of the most notable things in the article is that GitHub still uses a ["No JS? No problem."](https://twitter.com/_hmig/status/1541935737540591616) approach to web development (as in, [progressive enhancement](/progressive-enhancement-the-new-hotness/)).

> With JavaScript disabled, you’re still able to log in, comment on issues and pull requests (although our rich markdown toolbar won’t work), browse source code (with syntax highlighting), search for repositories, and even star, watch, or fork them. Popover menus even work, thanks to the clever use of the HTML `<details>` element.

In an era where so many big websites only work with JS, this is, in my opinion, the "right" way to build a website: basic features always work, and JavaScript enhances what's already there.
