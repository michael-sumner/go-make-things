One of the hardest things about learning how to code is being able to actually put all of your learning together to _build a thing_.

You can memorize JavaScript methods and browser API and understand the fundamentals, but building a project from scratch is hard.

**So, a few years ago, I put together [the Vanilla JS Academy, an online JavaScript workshop](https://vanillajsacademy.com).**

A new session starts on July 18, and enrollment opens up on Monday. A lot's changed with the program over the last year, and today, I wanted to tell you about it.

## How it works

Over the course of the 6-week workshop, you'll get access to over 70 lessons and work on 18 projects.

- **Every other day, you get a project to work on,** 1-3 short lessons that provide some background, and a template to help you get started.
- **On the in-between days,** I share my approach to the project and some of the common challenges and “gotchas” that students often run into.

If you get stuck, there’s a private Slack channel exclusively for students. I hold live video office hours every two weeks, where you can ask me questions in real time, share code, and work through bigger challenges.

## Two different workshops

When Academy started, it was just a single workshop. Today, there are two different programs.

1. **[Vanilla JS Essentials.](https://vanillajsacademy.com/essentials/)** Learn the fundamentals of DOM manipulation and injection, working with APIs and asynchronous JavaScript, managing data with arrays and objects, and saving state with browser storage.
2. **[Structure & Scale.](https://vanillajsacademy.com/advanced/)** Learn how to structure and organize your code as your projects grow and scale. Dig into concepts like utility libraries, object-oriented programing, JavaScript classes, web components, ES modules, and service workers.

The workshops run concurrently, and are designed to be taken one at a time. 

I've had students sign up for both at the same time and it never works out well. The stuff you do in _Structure & Scale_ assumes you've already have the skills you'd learn in _Essentials_, and the volume of work is just too high to take both together.

## _Structure & Scale_ has been completely redesigned

The _Structure & Scale_ workshop is relatively new.

Based on feedback from past participants, I completely redesigned the program for the upcoming session. It has new projects, new lessons, and a stronger focus on how to actually manage code bases as they get bigger.

This session is _very_ pirate themed. You'll build...

- A JS library for rolling dice of different sizes
- A _Treasure Chest_ library for managing all of your loot
- A web component for adding digital dice to a UI with just an HTML element
- _Seven Seas_, an offline-ready travel app for pirates

You'll also learn...

- How to more easily write libraries with JS classes
- How to modularize a growing code base
- How to add hooks other developers can use to extend the functionality of your code
- How to improve performance and reliability with Service Workers
- How to use build tools to bundle your code

If you're growing into a more senior role (or looking to make the jump), this is an awesome program to level-up your skills!

## How can you sign up?

**[Registration opens up on Monday, June 27.](https://vanillajsacademy.com)**

The first week of registration, I run an Early Bird Sale, with 40-percent off registration. If you're thinking about joining, next week is definitely the week to do it.
