When it comes to just about anything, habits matter more than skill or intelligence.

The best developers I know&mdash;the ones I look up to and learn from&mdash;aren't naturally gifted geniuses who just "know all the things." They're people who've built habits.

Nearly every day, they learn a little something new. Nearly every day, they share a little something new that they learned.

Wash. Rinse. Repeat.

Keeping up with everything in our industry is impossible. Trying to do so is a great way to burn yourself out.

Whether you're brand new to coding or a seasoned professional, building a habit of small, incremental "micro-learning" is an effective way to never get bored and keep your skills growing without feeling totally overwhelmed.

This is one of the core learning principles in [the Vanilla JS Academy workshops](https://vanillajsacademy.com). A few short lessons, and a project to apply what you learned. Wash. Rinse. Repeat.
