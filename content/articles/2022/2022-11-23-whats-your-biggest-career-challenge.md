I'm working on a new thing, and I was wondering...

**What's your biggest career or job search challenge?**

Before I was a web developer, I was an HR guy who specialized in career development for software engineers.

I have a bit of inside knowledge on how the recruiting process works, how to write resumes that actually get seen by a human being, how to navigate the interview process, and how to hack your career in general.

I'm working on a set of career resources for new or early career developers, and I'd love to know: what's your biggest career or job search challenge?
