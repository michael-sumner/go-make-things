Yesterday, I wrote an article that I knew was going to be a bit controversial: [masking is an inclusion and accessibility issue](/masking-is-an-inclusion-and-accessibility-issue/).

The funny thing about writing articles like this is that people tend to show you exactly who they are. It's a great way to purge an email list of assholes.

**No one who wrote back actually disagreed that masking is an inclusion issue.** I'm happy to have that conversation. 

Instead, I got several replies that some version of...

> Someone else's disability or vulnerability is not my problem. They can figure out how to manage it or not attend.

To paraphrase Julianna Roswell, they're willing to [actively exclude certain people from industry events](https://twitter.com/JuliannaRowsell/status/1538666270316548103).

I have zero tolerance for that. One of the perks of running your own business is that you can choose to not do business with assholes.

Everything about my business&mdash;my courses, my workshops, the community I manage&mdash;they're all geared around building a web _and_ a learning environment that's warm and welcoming.

If you're willing to exclude certain people from events for your own personal comfort, you can't be part of that.
