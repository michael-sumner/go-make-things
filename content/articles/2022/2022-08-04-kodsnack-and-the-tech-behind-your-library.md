I recently had the pleasure of [chatting with Fredrik Bj√∂reman from the Kodsnack podcast about about the joys (and challenges) of vanilla JS](https://kodsnack.se/484/).

Fredrik and I talked about how I became the vanilla JS guy, why I hate _that_ joke website, why devs tend to use so many libraries, and why vanilla JS (or something _more_ vanilla, anyways) is often a better choice.
