A few years ago, I noticed that a lot of people who are learning JavaScript struggle with putting all of the moving parts together into a working project.

They read tutorials, follow along with other people's code, and look stuff up on MDN, but when it's time to sit down and create a project from scratch... nothing! They get stuck. They don't know how to start.

**[The Vanilla JS Academy](https://vanillajsacademy.com) is a project-based workshop I created specifically to address this challenge, and it's quickly become my most successful learning resource.**

A new session is starting on April 4, and registration opens up next week.

## How it works

This immersive, 6-week program includes a combination of over 70 lessons, 18 projects, and live conversations with both me and other students.

- **Every other day, you get a project to work on**, 1-3 short lessons that provide some background, and a template to help you get started.
- **On the in-between days, I share my approach to the project** and some of the common challenges and “gotchas” that students often run into.

If you get stuck, there’s a **24/7 private Slack channel** exclusively for students, and **video office hours** every few weeks.

## Workshops tailored to your learning journey

The next session of the [Vanilla JS Academy](https://vanillajsacademy.com#the-workshops) includes two different workshops.

<ol class="list-spaced">
	<li><strong><a href="https://vanillajsacademy.com/essentials">Vanilla JS Essentials.</a></strong> Learn the fundamentals of DOM manipulation and injection, working with APIs and asynchronous JavaScript, managing data with arrays and objects, and saving state with browser storage.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="https://vanillajsacademy.com/advanced">Structure &amp; Scale.</a></strong> Learn how to structure and organize your code as your projects grow and scale. Dig into concepts like revealing module patterns, object-oriented programing (OOP), chaining, immutability, ES modules, and service workers.</li>
</ol>

**_Essentials_ is designed for people who are early in the process of learning JavaScript.** 

Maybe you're just starting out. Maybe you've been trying to learn for a while but things just aren't clicking. Maybe you're already employed as a junior developer, and want to feel more confident.

**_Structure & Scale_ is tailored for people who feel very comfortable with JavaScript fundamentals, and want to move to the next level.**

If you find yourself copy-and-pasting code a lot, or struggling to maintain code bases as they grow larger, this program is for you.

## Early bird registration opens up on Monday (March 14)

[The next session of the Vanilla JS Academy](https://vanillajsacademy.com) starts on April 4 and runs through May 14. 

**Next week only, you'll be able to save 40% on registration with Early Bird Registration.** After that, the program returns to it's regular price of $799 (or $299 paid in three monthly installments).

I hope to see you there! If you have any questions, [feel free to reach out](/about).
