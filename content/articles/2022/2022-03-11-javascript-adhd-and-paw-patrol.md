Last night, I had the pleasure of [chatting with the Thunder Nerds team about JavaScript, ADHD, and building a career in tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDf7nXKmeZI). We also had a good rant about the many plot holes and inconsistencies in the PAW Patrol universe.

This was one of the most fun and chaotic podcasts I've ever had the pleasure of being on. I hope you [enjoy watching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDf7nXKmeZI) as much as I enjoyed chatting with Frederick, Brian, and Vincent.
