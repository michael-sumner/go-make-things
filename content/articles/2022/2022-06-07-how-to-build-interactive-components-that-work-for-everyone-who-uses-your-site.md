I _just_ launched a brand new course and book: [Accessible Components with Vanilla JS](https://vanillajsguides.com/accessible-components/).

<img class="img-center img-hero" alt="" src="/img/guides/accessible-components.png">

This course covers the ins-and-outs of building accessible, interactive UI components in about an hour. You'll learn...

- What assistive technology is
- How to enable and use a screen reader
- The basics of navigating the web with a keyboard
- The dangers of CSS-only interactive components
- The importance of HTML semantics
- Focus management essentials
- How to hide content, and accessibility considerations when doing so
- How to announce dynamic changes to the UI
- How to indicate button state
- How to build four of the most common interactive components

If you already own my [complete set of pocket guides](https://vanillajsguides.com/complete-set/) or [the expert bundle](https://vanillajsguides.com/expert-bundle/), this is a free upgrade (and if you buy one of them, the course is included at a steep discount).

Curious what the course is like? [Here's a sample lesson.](https://vanillajsguides.com/accessible-components/#a-sample-lesson)

As part of the course, we'll build a collection of accessible UI components, including a show/hide disclosure, accordion, tabs, and a notification component.

Many thanks to [LÃ©onie Watson from TetraLogical](https://tetralogical.com/) for providing a technical edit of the course to ensure the recommendations in it are actually, well... good!
