This kind of thing continues to be one of my biggest attractions to a more browser-native experience.

I have _so many_ projects I built just a few years ago using Gulp that are littered with broken dependencies. If I need to make any updates, I first need to patch a bunch of out-of-date NPM dependencies. 

Often, that involves replacing at least one or two that have been deprecated, or rewriting my build setup because of a breaking major version change.

That's not to say I don't use any build tools. I do. [But I built my own to be as close-to-the-metal as possible.](/my-build-tool-boilerplate-goes-v2/)

The goal with vanilla JS or [the lean web](https://leanweb.dev) is _not_ to completely shun tooling or write every line of code yourself.

It's to lean heavily on what the platform gives you out of the box as a strategy for delivery a better user experience with fewer long-term maintenance issues. 

Where most people look at robust tooling as an asset, I often see a long-term liability that creates more headaches down the road.
