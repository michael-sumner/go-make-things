I started learning to code during this magical time when much of what jQuery had pioneered had _just_ been implemented natively in browsers under ES5.

Learning to code wasn't _easy_, but the barriers to entry were low. You could just open a text editor, open a browser, and get to work.

Fast forward just a few years, and the whole landscape had changed.

Libraries and frameworks dominated the market. Build tools where treated as a necessity. Nearly every tutorial started with, "just open up the command line and..." or, "just install Angular/Vue/React and...".

What used to be simple and fun suddenly felt _complicated and over-engineered_.

A big part of why I started teaching vanilla JS&mdash;writing this newsletter, speaking at conferences, and creating courses and workshops&mdash;was to show people that you can still build great web experiences without a lot of tools, and that the process can be _easier and better_ than a more complex workflow.

One of the things I discovered along the way is that there are _a lot of people_ who feel the same way I do, and long for a simpler, more resilient web experience.

**I'm working on something new: [the Lean Web Club](https://leanwebclub.com/).**

It's a learning space for people who hate the complexity of modern web development. When you join, you get unlimited access to courses and tutorials, projects, learning paths, live events, a curated resource library, and a vibrant developer community.

**You can do things like...**

- Watch or read a few short tutorials on a topic you're struggling with or need a quick reference for (like how to sanitize API data, or detect clicks outside of an element).
- Find fun projects to work on, with a starting template, links to relevant tutorials, and a walk-through of my approach.
- Attend online events like open Q&As, live-coding sessions, and interviews with cool people.
- Follow learning paths, collections of tutorials, projects, and events focused on a narrow topic (like how to build a web app or build an offline site).
- Find recommended tools, libraries, and code snippets to help you build faster and more resilient web experiences.
