I just learned about the [Advent of JavaScript](https://www.adventofjs.com/), 24 JavaScript project challenges for the holiday season.

You can get all 24 challenges for free, and for just $24, you can also get the solution walk-throughs. The advent started on December 1, but there's still plenty of time to join and start working on them if you want.

This looks crazy fun, and I'm honestly super jealous that I didn't think of it!
