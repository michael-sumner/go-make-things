Another day, another turd on Twitter telling people they can't call themselves a programmer if they "only" know HTML and CSS.

Here's the thing, CSS _is_ a programming language.

All the arguments that it's not fell apart ages ago. CSS can hold variables. It can interact with user inputs. [You can build (inaccessible) apps and videos games entirely with HTML and CSS.](https://github.com/yurkagon/Doom-Nukem-CSS)

But even if that _weren't_ true, I don't give a single shit what makes something a "real programming language."

That debate has just one purpose: to gatekeep people. Just stop.
