Last week, my friend Anton Gunnarsson gave [a lightning talk at Nordic.js called _CSS \*is\* awesome_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo3px1L3H70).

In his talk, Anton shares a handful of examples of how modern CSS can create beautiful, interactive UI with just a few lines of code.

I love this trend of CSS doing things with just one line of code that used to require tons of JavaScript. I hope to see more of that in the future.

One point of note: one or two of Anton's demos aren't fully accessible, and would still require JS to meet all A11Y needs. They're still a great showcase of how far the platform has come!
