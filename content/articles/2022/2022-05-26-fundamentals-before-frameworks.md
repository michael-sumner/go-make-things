I recently had the pleasure of chatting with Sean Smith, Mike Mella, and Amanda Lutz from the Website 101 Podcast about [why learning web development fundamentals are so important](https://website101podcast.com/episodes/season-05/episode-9/vanilla-javascript-fundamentals-before-frameworks/).

We covered a wide range of topics, from accessibility to performance to when you _should_ reach for a library. We also talked a bit about being a developer with ADHD.
