title: How I structure my vanilla JavaScript plugins [video]
---

Over the last couple of weeks, a few people have mentioned that they didn't fully understand what's going on in my JavaScript plugins.

I thought it might be helpful to [walk through one of my plugins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGMOskYb-ho) and walk you through how I set things up, and why. You can [watch the video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGMOskYb-ho).

This is definitely a little rough around the edges. If I did a bad job explaining anything, please let me know!
