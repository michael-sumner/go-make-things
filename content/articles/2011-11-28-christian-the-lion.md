I thought this was fake until I looked it up on Wikipedia. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDZaWgf_bk0">The story of Christian the Lion...</a>

<blockquote>Christian was a lion originally purchased by Australians John Rendall and Anthony "Ace" Bourke from Harrods department store of London, England in 1969 and ultimately reintroduced to the African wild by conservationist George Adamson. One year after George Adamson released Christian to the wild, his former owners decided to go looking for him to see whether Christian would remember them. He did, and with him were two lionesses who accepted the men as well.</blockquote>
