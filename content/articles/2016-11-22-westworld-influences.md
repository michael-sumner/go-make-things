HBO's WestWorld is my favorite show on TV right now. [IGN put together a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95HP9gVigdo) that discusses the original 1970's movie, it's influences on both the show and other sci-fi films, and other shows and pop culture that have influenced the show.

It's well worth a watch.

Unlike many fans, I've been *trying* to avoid coming up with too many theories of the show. I like to let the story take me where it wants to get. I enjoy the surprise more than "figuring it out before they tell me."

But it's been *really* hard to do with this show.
