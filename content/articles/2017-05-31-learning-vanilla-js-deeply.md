title: Learning Vanilla JS Deeply
---

As a nice follow-up to [yesterday's article](/how-to-really-learn-javascript/), a few weeks ago I had an awesome conversation with [Zac Gordon of JavaScript for WordPress](https://javascriptforwp.com/) about how I learned vanilla JS.

[He just posted our chat on his site.](https://javascriptforwp.com/show/ep-5-learning-vanilla-javascript-chris-ferdinandi/) Head over there to watch or listen.
