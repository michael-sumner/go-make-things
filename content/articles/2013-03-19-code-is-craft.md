title: Code is Craft
---

In this absolutely brilliant talk from Fronteers 2012, Phil Hawksworth uses the phrase, "<a href="http://vimeo.com/53317254">Code is craft</a>."

Phil's premise: If you care about the craft of writing good code, than you should be mindful of the CMS you choose for your clients. It can often let them destroy the beautiful code you work so hard to create.

It's a bit long, but it's worth watching the whole thing.
