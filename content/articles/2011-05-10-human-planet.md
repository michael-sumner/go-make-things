I graduated with a degree in anthropology. I find the human story - our myriad of cultures and habitats - absolutely fascinating.

I'm pretty pumped about <em><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/humanplanet">Human Planet</a></em>, a jaw-dropping series from the BBC.

I watched a few episodes last week. It's like Disney's stunning movie <em><a href="http://disneydvd.disney.go.com/disneynature-earth.html">Earth</a></em>, but about humans. The cinematography, the stories... it's simply amazing. I may just have to buy the DVD set.
