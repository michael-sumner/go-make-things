This video about [the terrible design of doors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY96hTb8WgI) really hits home.

When I worked at Constant Contact, the main set of doors into the office off of the elevator had pull handles on both sides. One side had a label indicating whether you should push or pull it. The other had a label that read, "Guess."

I'm not kidding. I got it wrong every single day. I loved worked there, but I f*cking hated that door.
