<blockquote>"Some of the burden shifts to the people creating the technology to think on behalf of the user, 'Can we make the default experience one that respects their privacy, one that respects the permanence of their data, one that respects their preferences about who they share with, and one that respects their goals of communicating with people regardless of what network they're on?'"

- Anil Dash</blockquote>

I thoroughly enjoyed this fantastic conversation with Anil Dash on <a href="http://dashes.com/anil/2013/05/the-web-we-lost-and-other-losses.html">the walled gardens of modern social networks and the ethos of the early web</a>. This is definitely worth 15 minutes of your time.
