I help teams build resilient, scalable websites and avoid costly mistakes.

- **Strategic & Technical Guidance.** Build with confidence! Get feedback on strategic direction, have designs and code reviewed by an expert, get recommendations on tools and approaches, and learn about emerging techniques and best practices.
- **Implementation.** Need help building your site or adding custom functionality? My code has been used by organizations like Apple and Harvard Business School.
- **Training & Education.** Level-up your team's JavaScript skills. I provide self-paced and project-based training that will give your developers a deeper understanding of how to build for the web.
