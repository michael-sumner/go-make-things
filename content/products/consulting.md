## How does consulting work?

We start with a kick-off workshop to identify your goals and challenges, and create a project plan. Throughout the duration of your project, I’ll be available to review progress, answer questions, and generally keep the code clean from the outset.

<p class="margin-bottom-small"><em>I'm available to...</em></p>

- Provide feedback on strategic direction
- Review of designs, code, and works-in-progress
- Recommend tools, approaches, processes, and workflows
- Share emerging technologies, techniques, and best practices
- Provide situational responsiveness to related needs that require my assistance

We'll have regular meetings by phone or video conference. In between meetings, you have unlimited, 24/7 access to me by email and chat.

	<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> This is not a “developer-for-hire” arrangement. I provide code samples and design sketches as needed, but authoring shipping code, designs, and documentation is beyond the scope of the retainer.</em></p>
	<p><em>Consulting availability is extremely limited, and you can be added to the wait list if no spots are available.</em></p>
