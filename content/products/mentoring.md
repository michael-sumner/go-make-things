Are you sick of digging through hostile web forums, incomplete documentation, and confusing or incomplete tutorials? Do you buy books and courses, but never finish them because you can't find them time or motivation?

With my private, personalized mentoring program, you can master vanilla JavaScript with the help of a trusted expert.

## How it works

At the beginning of the program, I'll conduct an **initial assessment** and provide **structured assignments** based on your learning goals.

You get direct, 1-on-1 access to me through **weekly video chats**. In between calls, you can **email me** or **send me a private message**. I'll help you work through challenges or issues you've run into, provide feedback on your code, and identify what to learn or focus on next.

You are welcome to record our calls for future reference.

- My **Vanilla JavaScript Toolkit**, which is loaded with code snippets, helper functions, boilerplates, polyfills, and recommended third-party plugins.
- My **Complete Set of Vanilla JS Pocket Guides** in ebook and video format, including all of the source code, demos, and bonus content.
- Access to my **exclusive Slack channel**, where you can send me private messages or chat with other students.
