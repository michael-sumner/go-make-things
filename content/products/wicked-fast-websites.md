## 3 boilerplates to speed up your development time

*Wicked Fast Websites* comes with three awesome boilerplates to help dramatically speed up your development time.

1. **Gulp Boilerplate.** Use Gulp to combine files, remove whitespace, automatically add version numbers to your theme, and more!
2. **CodeKit Boilerplate.** Prefer GUIs over command line? No problem. Use CodeKit to combine files and remove whitespace from your website files.
3. **PHP Cheatsheet.** Copy-and-paste code for implementing all of the WordPress-specific techniques discussed in the book.

## Table of Contents

Here's everything that's in the book.

1. **Why web performance matters.** A look at some data that explains why web performance matters.
2. **Measuring performance.** When it comes to web performance, how fast is fast enough? And what's the right way to measure it?
3. **Combining files.** Combining similar file types togetherâ€”--a process known as concatenationâ€”--improves web performance. What are some tools and techniques for doing this, especially when dealing with third-party plugins and themes?
4. **Social Sharing Buttons.** Social sharing buttons provided by sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ all load a bunch of additional files behind the scenes and you might not even realize it.
5. **Better CSS Loading.** A new technique---Critical Path CSS---can dramatically improve the perceived load time of your site.
6. **Better JavaScript Loading.** JavaScript is often the biggest bottleneck in your site's performance. Let's explore some techniques to improve it.
7. **Fixing Fonts.** Loading web fonts often results in a Flash of Invisible Text (FOIT) that leaves the page unusable until it loads.
8. **Lightning Fast Tapping.** Many mobile browsers introduce a 300ms delay when a user taps on a link or button. This is why web apps feel *so* much slower than native apps.
9. **Remove White Space.** Removing white space in your CSS and JavaScript files can reduce file size by 75% or more. How do you do this with third-party plugins and themes?
10. **Smarter Images.** Images now account for almost two-thirds of the total weight of an average web page. This has a huge impact on performance.
11. **SVGs.** A vector-based image format that can keep your image files smaller and more crisp on high-density screens.
12. **Responsive Images.** How to send different images based on the visitor's screen size, density, and more.
13. **Gzip.** A simple server setting that can reduce the size of your website by 70%.
14. **Expires Headers.** Reduce latency by telling browser to hold on to reused files for future visits.
15. **The Magic Plugin.** The one plugin you should always install that will have a rediculous huge impact on your site's performance.
16. **Putting it all together.** A recap of everything from the book, and what to do now.
