## No one ever teaches you how to have a successful career.

- What should you learn next?
- How do you write a resume that actually gets looked at?
- How do you answer the question, "So, how much are you making now?"
- How do you negotiate a salary?
- How on earth do you have a 5-year plan in an industry that changes every week.

This is the stuff they don't teach you in school.


## A successful career is about building habits.

There's no such thing as an overnight success.

All successful web developers share a set of habits and behaviors. They talk to a lot of people. They never stop learning. They share what they know with others. They solve problems. You can build these habits.

*The Web Developer Career Guide* provides you with **a blueprint for building a successful career**. It also gives you a **behind-the-scenes look at the hiring process**, so you can learn how to get a job that you'll love and get paid what you deserve.


## Here's what you'll learn

*The Web Developer Career Guide* covers the entire career process, from figuring out what you want to do to getting hired.

- The three key behaviors all successful developers have in common.
- How to keep up in an industry that's constantly changing.
- How to find a new job without submitting resumes to the job board black hole.
- How to write resumes that get read by an actual human.
- How to kick ass at your next job interview.
- How to negotiate your salary and get paid what you deserve.

## Table of Contents

Here's everything that's in the book.

1. **Intro.** As an industry, we spend a lot of time talking about innovative CSS techniques, the latest JavaScript frameworks, and new HTML elements. We also spend a fair bit of time talking about freelancing, how to market our services, interact with clients, and price our work.
2. **How to figure out what to do next.** The most common question I get asked is, "How do I figure out what to do next?" Learn the one magic question you can ask to figure that out.
3. **How to keep up.** Once you're a more seasoned developer, you start to feel like you can't keep up with the pace of change in our industry.
4. **How to find out about open roles.** There are three ways you can find open roles. Some are better than others.
5. **Your online portfolio sucks (and how to fix it).** Is your portfolio an asset, or is it keeping you from getting the roles you want?
6. **Why job hunting sucks so bad.** Because, the internet. And also, recruiters are overwhelmed. I'll show you how to hack the process to your advantage.
7. **Your resume sucks (and how to fix it).** Your resume probably sucks. And as a result, the people who could hire you aren't even looking at it.
8. **How to kick ass at your next job interview.** Interviews aren't always fun. I'll give you some practical techniques for kicking-ass at your next one.
9. **How to get paid what you deserve.** What if you ask for too much and they decline? What if you ask for too little and screw yourself out of money? How do you know what a reasonable salary is for the role?
10. **What now?** How to take what you've learned and go have a kick-ass career.
