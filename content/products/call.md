## How It Works

1-on-1 Coaching Calls are 60 minutes long, and take place over Zoom. 

You share the biggest JavaScript challenges you’re facing, and I'll give you immediate, practical advice about what to do next.

<p class="margin-bottom-small"><strong>Common areas of interest include...</strong></p>

- How to start or approach a specific project.
- How to structure and maintain code as it scales.
- The pros and cons of different programming approaches.
- Help fixing a bug or broken code.
- Career challenges and job advice.

I’ll give you **personalized advice that you can put into action immediately** based on years of teaching JavaScript and writing code for some of the world’s best organizations.

You are welcome to record the call for future reference. Once you submit your payment, you’ll receive a link to schedule a 60 minute appointment in my calendar.
