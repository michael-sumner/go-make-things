{{<project title="Blackbeard" url="https://stagingcs1.mashery.com" summary="A JavaScript templating library that provides TIBCO Mashery's API management software clients with more flexibility and control over their online developer documentation.">}}
- Used dozens of client conversations to inform key feature development, resulting in a robust set of strongly desired new features that our customers love.
- Open sourced a collection of "starter templates" based on common design patterns and use cases, and turned them into a [theme builder](https://developer.mashery.com/docs/read/customizing_your_portal/Theme_Builder) using the GitHub content API. This has helped customers who want to DIY build portals faster and easier so they can focus on running top-notch API programs.
- Designed a robust JavaScript API that enables clients to build their own features and use their developer portal in new and interesting ways. Many of these innovations make their way back into the core code as new features.
