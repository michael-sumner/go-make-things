## Refund policy

That's it. That's the whole policy.



## Privacy Policy

I deliberately collect as little information about you as possible.

When you make a purchase, your email address and what you purchased are saved. This information is used to provide you access to your Products, and to send you invoices, updates, and information about related products.

When you pay for your Products, your payment information and billing address are sent to a payment processor for processing. Go Make Things does *not* save your payment or billing information.

If you have a discussion on the Community, your messages will be visible to all other members of the Community. Messages are retained forever, though you can delete yours at any time. The last 10,000 messages posted in Community (total, not just your own) are visible and searchable by any member.

If you email me with a question or to ask for help, I often keep that correspondence, and the email address, for future reference.
