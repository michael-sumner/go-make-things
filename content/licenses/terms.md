## Refund policy

That's it. That's the whole policy.



## Privacy Policy

I deliberately collect as little information about you as possible.

When you make a purchase, your email address and what you purchased are saved. This information is used to provide you access to your Products, and to send you invoices, updates, and information about related products.

When you pay for your Products, your payment information and billing address are sent to a payment processor for processing. Go Make Things does *not* save your payment or billing information.

If you have a discussion on the Community, your messages will be visible to all other members of the Community. Messages are retained forever, though you can delete yours at any time. The last 10,000 messages posted in Community (total, not just your own) are visible and searchable by any member.

If you email me with a question or to ask for help, I often keep that correspondence, and the email address, for future reference.

<!-- ## No Fascists/Republicans

The GOP has become the de facto fascist party. The policies they support are racist, sexist, anti-disability, anti-LGBTQ, and anti-international. They treat people they deem inferior with cruelty and contempt.

I have many wonderful students with diverse backgrounds, ethnicities, gender identities, and sexual orientations. Support for the Republican Party means supporting policies and positions that actively harm those students.

I believe that you end up with the community that you deserve. I believe my job is to make sure it remains a place where people can be themselves, grow, and learn.

As a result, Republicans cannot purchase my products or services. -->
